# Welcome to My Repository!

After many years in the Visual FX industry, I’ve decided to share some of the tools I’ve developed. There are free to use and royalty-free. 
You are allowed to use them in commercial productions, provided that I am credited as the author. However, resale of these content is strictly prohibited.

## What's Inside

- **MaxScript**: MaxScript is the native scripting language for 3ds Max. You can drag and drop the `.ms` files into 3ds Max to run them, or create a custom macro for quick access.
  
- **Max Files**: Some setups not only involve scripting but require a full scene, including rigs, tyFlow setups, objects, etc.

- **tyFlow Scripts**: These are written in C# and need to be loaded into a script operator in the tyFlow editor.

- **Houdini HDAs**: Ready-to-use assets you can easily import into your Houdini projects.

- **Houdini Python Scripts**: These Python scripts can be added to your Houdini shelf to automate common tasks.

## Quick Tips

To quickly access an external script in 3ds Max, use the following code:

```maxscript

```
